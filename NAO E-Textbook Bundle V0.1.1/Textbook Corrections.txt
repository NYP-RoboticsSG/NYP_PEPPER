Textbook Mistakes:

9 Remember That: Adding the dialog box code from the textbook will render NAO unable to continue playing after the user asks him to do so.
This is fixed in the example solution by using the gotoReactivate function instead of the nextProposal function. (Page 69)

14 NAO as a calculator: Adding the Python Script code from the textbook will result in NAO unable to give float numbers (decimals) as answers when tasked with division.
This is fixed in the example solution by adding from "__future__ import division". (Page 105)

19 Your own Basic Channel!: If you use the workbook's qichat code, NAO will say "That's a shame" if you reply "so" to NAO when he asks how are you.
This is fixed by adding parenthesis to signify you are looking for a specific phrase rather than individual words. (Page 131)
